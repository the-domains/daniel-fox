            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Wizard, the Farmer, and the Very Petty Princess</h1><p>The evil undead are marching. As the human kingdoms stand on the brink of extinction, the reluctant farmer Idwal is forced into adventure, shanghaied by a vain princess, tricked out of his money by a cackling miser, and finds much to his surprise that he's starting to like it all. As he gets swept along he'll meet reluctant kings, wicked witches, mourning dwarves, and the surprisingly lively undead, as he is caught between the Princess Willuna who seeks to show herself a serious young woman and the wizard Bodolomous who is determined to prove himself The Most Evil Man Alive.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/474da1a4-71a8-4bb9-abf2-83258d6ed6cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>
