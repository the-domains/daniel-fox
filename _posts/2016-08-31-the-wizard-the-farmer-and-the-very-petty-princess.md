  The evil undead are marching. As the human kingdoms stand on the brink of

  a vain princess, tricked out of his money by a cackling miser, and finds much
  to his surprise that he's starting to like it all.   As he gets swept along
  he'll meet reluctant kings, wicked witches, mourning dwarves, and the
  surprisingly lively undead, as he is caught between the Princess Willuna who

  determined to prove himself The Most Evil Man Alive.
